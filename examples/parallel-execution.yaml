# FORGE Parallel Execution Example
#
# This example demonstrates how to use parallel execution to run
# independent tasks simultaneously, reducing overall pipeline time.

version: "1.0"

stages:
  # Example 1: Parallel Testing
  # Run different test suites concurrently
  - name: test
    parallel: true
    steps:
      - name: Unit Tests
        image: node:18-alpine
        command: |
          echo "Running unit tests..."
          npm run test:unit

      - name: Integration Tests
        image: node:18-alpine
        command: |
          echo "Running integration tests..."
          npm run test:integration

      - name: End-to-End Tests
        image: node:18-alpine
        command: |
          echo "Running e2e tests..."
          npm run test:e2e

  # Example 2: Multi-Language Build
  # Build different parts of a multi-service application
  - name: build
    parallel: true
    steps:
      - name: Build Frontend
        image: node:18-alpine
        command: |
          cd frontend
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Build Backend API
        image: golang:1.21-alpine
        command: |
          cd backend
          go mod download
          go build -o api ./cmd/api

      - name: Build Worker Service
        image: python:3.11-alpine
        command: |
          cd worker
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python setup.py build
    depends_on:
      - test

  # Example 3: Sequential Deployment (after parallel builds)
  - name: deploy
    parallel: false
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        image: alpine:latest
        command: |
          echo "Deploying to staging..."
          # Your deployment script here
    depends_on:
      - build

# Cache dependencies to speed up subsequent runs
